            <ul>
                <li><strong>1976</strong> - On March 24th, Argentina is hit by a military dictatorship that suppresses civil rights, among them, freedom of expression in all its forms, thus beginning a period of silencing of ideas that led to a process of disappearance, torture and death. </li>
                <li><strong>1979</strong> - The need arises, from different sectors of society, to denounce, effectively, what is happening, and the idea of reacting through the different forms of art begins to take shape seriously.</li>
                <li><strong>1980</strong> - A group of directors and theater actors from Buenos Aires begin to think of a response to political oppression, claiming the role of Argentine theater as a channel of expression of resistance to fascism.</li>
                <li><strong>1981 - July 28th</strong> - At six pm, the then president of the Argentine Association of Actors, the actor Jorge Rivera López, stands on the stage of the Teatro del Picadero and begins, with the reading of a text written by the author Carlos Somigliana, the most important theatrical movement in Argentine history. "Why do we do Open Theater?" he asks to a crowd. So, it is arranged to present three short works per day, each of which can not last more than thirty minutes. The performances begin at 6 p.m. to be able to count on the participation of professional actors. The scenographies have few elements and the protagonists of the works themselves are in charge of moving them between one and the other set. None of the participants charge their fees and the low cost allows the price of the seats to be halved.</li>
                <li><strong>1981 - August 6th</strong> - A week after the cycle opened , a paramilitary group plants three incendiary bombs in the Teatro del Picadero. The room is totally destroyed.</li>
                <li><strong>1981 - August 7th </strong> - 16 theatres offer to present the plays. One hundred and twenty painters donate paintings to raise funds. The press also accompanies that project. A few days later the cycle is reopened in the Tabaris room, and in the course of two months more than 25,000 spectators pass through there. In this first meeting participate 21 authors, 21 directors, 150 actors and several dozen technicians and spontaneous collaborators.</li>
                <li><strong>1982</strong> - A competition of works is called, to which 412 texts, 120 directors and more than 1,500 actors are submitted. Fifty plays are chosen in which fifty directors, 415 actors and a hundred technicians and collaborators participate. Several young directors -coming from the experimental field- access more recognized plans of work and many actors jump into the professional field. This time Teatro Abierto occupies two rooms: the Odeón theater and the Margarita Xirgu.</li>
                <li><strong>1983</strong> - Teatro Abierto decides to win the street. The cycle began with a march that brought together 25,000 people shouting slogans against censorship and dictatorship.</li>
                <li><strong>1983 - October 30th</strong> - First democratic elections after a long period of darkness. Culture fulfills its mission, the country is open again.</li>
